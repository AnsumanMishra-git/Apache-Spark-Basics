# Apache-Spark-Basics

This repository contains a collection of questions and their answers related to the basics of Apache Spark that I have come across while doing my courses. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone seeking to practice their learning, after all the learning amounts to nothing if not tried and tested.

## Introduction  

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. Spark is built to be fast, general-purpose, and easy to use, providing a unified framework for various data processing tasks, including batch processing, interactive queries, real-time streaming, and machine learning.  

Here are some key features and reasons why Apache Spark is considered better for big data processing compared to traditional data processing frameworks:    

### 1.In-Memory Processing:  
Spark leverages in-memory computing, which allows it to cache data in memory, significantly speeding up data processing. This capability is especially advantageous for iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis.  

### 2.Fault Tolerance:  
Spark provides built-in fault tolerance through resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). RDDs are immutable distributed collections of data, which can recover automatically from node failures, ensuring data reliability and integrity.  

### 3.Ease of Use:  
Spark offers high-level APIs in languages like Scala, Java, Python, and R, making it accessible to a wide range of developers. Its concise and expressive APIs make it easier to write complex data processing tasks with less code.  

### 4.Unified Data Processing:  
Spark provides a unified processing model, enabling developers to write applications that can seamlessly integrate batch processing, interactive queries, and real-time streaming in a single system.  

### 5.Compatibility with Hadoop:  
Spark can run directly on top of Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) and can also integrate with Hadoop's YARN resource manager, making it compatible with existing Hadoop deployments.  

### 6.Real-time Stream Processing:  
Spark Streaming enables real-time stream processing, allowing applications to process and analyze data in near real-time, making it suitable for real-time analytics and event-driven applications.
